To start of with I will be using a cheap Arduino Nano clone which can be purchased for under £2 from China direct with a 2 - 3 week lead time from Aliexpress.

I will also be using the Arduino Nano sensor shield also available from Aliexpress for under £2.

The final part is the MCP2515 module again these can be purchaed from AliExpress for £3.

I would also advise you purchase some Dupont female to female cables and some 3, 5, 8 way connector adapter,

# Please use the Wiki Tab.

I am using the Wiki to detail this project rather than the normal readme files.

Readme Last Updated 6/10/2024 

I will be starting this project back up over the next few months using a different library set

The pages will be going through a series of updates in October so please come back soon to find out the progress made.

## Hard coding sketches Changed

I have updated the examples of hard coding as some changes to the libraries had broken the sketches.

- The videos explantion that related to them will be incorrect now

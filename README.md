# Project put on hold

After careful consideration, I have decided to suspend the Arduino CBUS project. The existing libraries notwithstanding, there is a notable absence of suitable sketches for basic layout control at this time. I plan to reassess the situation in six months to determine if the MERG team has made any further progress.
